# Poroelastic_linear_stability
To example implementation that can be used used to produce the result in Heimisson, Rudnicki, and Lapusta (2021)

First, Solve_for_kcrit.m implements equations and sets parameters to determine the critical wavenumber for a dilatant fault in a poroelastic solid.
Second Solve_for_s_given_k.m implements equations and sets parameters to determine the solution to the characteristic equation given a wavenumber k. This means finding a solution to the general characteristic equation that describes stability of the fault in a poroelastic solid with a dilatancy at steady state sliding.
